	<h2><a name="general" href="#top">&uarr;</a>General concepts</h2>

<p>With Affiliate+, anyone can be an affiliate. That means that anyone can generate an affiliate link (though not every link will result in commission, taking advantage of flexible commission rules explained below).</p>

	<h2><a name="settings" href="#top">&uarr;</a>Settings</h2>

<p>Before proceeding, you need to save your settings. You will not be permitted to access rest of module's control panel before you do so.</p>
<p>The main settings are:
<br />
E-commerce solution used on your site (currently CartThrob and SimpleCommerce are supported)<br />
Minimum amount to withdraw (requests for smaller amounts will not be accepcted)<br />
Integrate with DevDemon credits module (if set, every commission will also be recorded and credit and can then be used using Credits gateway)
</p>
<p>PayPal MassPay API credentials are only required if you indend to perform payouts automatically using MassPay.</p>

	<h2><a name="rules" href="#top">&uarr;</a>Commission rules explained</h2>
	
<p>The advantage of Affiliate+ is its approach of using multiple commission rules. Different commission can be used depending on who generated the link, what has been purchased; certain limits can be applied etc.</p>	

<p>The 2 main types of commission rules are: <strong>fixed amount</strong> (credits, dollars) and <strong>percent from purchase</strong>.</p>

<p>The rules are getting applied to each product in the order in sequence defined by their priority. The total commission for the product is calculates as the sum of commissions that can be applied. If some rule is marked as "terminator", the rules of lower priority are not applied and commission not added (other rules of same priority might be applied or not).</p>
<p>The total commission for the purchase is calculated as the sum of commissions of each product. The rules used for each product can be different.</p>


<p>You can <strong>restrict</strong> each rule to be applied only to:<br />
&mdash; certain product groups (channels)<br />
&mdash; certain products<br />
&mdash; products with custom entry field set to "yes" or "1"<br />
&mdash; purchases by refferals of certain affiliates<br />
&mdash; purchases by refferals of certain affiliate groups (member groups)<br />
&mdash; purchases by refferals of certain affiliate categories (<a href="http://www.intoeetive.com/index.php/comments/member-categories">member categories</a>)<br />
&mdash; purchases by refferals of affiliates with custom profile field set to "yes" or "1"<br />
&mdash; purchases done using selected payment gateways
</p>

<p>Besides, you can make each rule be applicable only if following conditionals are met:<br />
&mdash; same product has been purchased by affiliate<br />
&mdash; the total amount of purchases by referral is greater than some amount<br />
&mdash; the total number of purchases by referral is more than some number<br />
&mdash; the refferal record was made not too ling ago (time defined in seconds)
</p>


<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>There are 3 rules: "Default rule" (medium priority) giving affiliate 1% from every purchase, "Premium products" rule (medium priority) giving 3% from purchase for selected products and "Special offer" (high priority), marked as exclusive,giving $3 for products marked with "special offer" custom field.</p>
<p>The referred customer A is byuing Product A for $100, which is noi in list of selected product, neither marked as special offer. The affiliate will get 1% = $1</p>
<p>The referred customer B is byuing Product B for $100, which IS in list of selected product, but not marked as special offer. The affiliate will get 1%+3% = $4</p>
<p>The referred customer C is byuing Product C for $100, which IS in list of selected product, and has "special offer" custom field set to "yes". The affiliate will get $3</p>


	<h2><a name="balance" href="#top">&uarr;</a>Balance and payouts</h2>

<h3><a name="balance-credits" href="#top">&uarr;</a>Credits integration</h3>

<p>If you have DevDemon Credits installed, you can perform integration of the modules with simply marking the checkbox in settings.</p>
<p>If you do so, every commission or payout record of Affiliate+ will be recorded as Credits action.</p>
<p>The system will assume that 1 dollar (or the currency unit that you use for your store) is equal to 1 credit.</p>
<p>With integration checkbox marked, the users will be able to spend their earned commission on your site instead of requesting payout (or in addition to that). Besides, they will not be able to request withdraw of amount greater than their Credits balance.</p>

<h3><a name="balance-withdraw" href="#top">&uarr;</a>Processing withdraws</h3>

<p>Once the total amount of commissions earned by member has reached the withdraw minimum you've set in settings (or anytime, if you left it empty) the user can request a payout/withdraw of funds.</p>
<p>This is done with help of <a href="#tags-withdraw">withdraw_request_form</a> tag.</p>
<p>Once the request has been submitted, the site admin receives notification to his email. The notification template can be edited in module's Control Panel, in Notification templates section.</p>
<p>The variables available in <strong>email notification template</strong> are:<br />
<em>{site_name}</em> &mdash; site name;<br />
<em>{site_url}</em> &mdash; site URL;<br />
<em>{amount}</em> &mdash; amount requested;<br />
<em>{member_id}</em> &mdash; affiliate member ID;<br />
<em>{username}</em> &mdash; affiliate username;<br />
<em>{screen_name}</em> &mdash; affiliate screen name;<br />
<em>{cp_link}</em> &mdash; link to payouts section of module's control panel.
</p>

<p>The current and past withdaw requests can be found in Payouts section of module control panel.</p>
<p>On that page, the admin can cancel the request or mark it as processed. When marking as processed, it is possible to record the method used for payout (PayPal, Bank transfer etc.), add corresponding Transaction ID and comment.</p>
<p>It is also possible to process all pending automatically using PayPal MassPay. The number of pending requests should be greater than 2. If you have more than 250 requests pending, be aware that only 250 requests will be submitted to MassPay at a time.</p>

	<h2><a name="stats" href="#top">&uarr;</a>Stats</h2>
	
<p>The Stats tab in module's Control Panel display affiliate statistics for your system.</p>	
<p>You can see the records for all commissions, including affiliate name, link to order details and customer profile.</p>
<p>You can also narrow down results by certain affiliate or display only selected period of time.</p>
